# Weather-Dashboard

## Website Summary

Welcome to my website where you can use this weather dashboard to search any city and display current weather data and a five-day forecast! You have the ability to use a search box that will load information as soon as you click search and recent searches will be saved. Saved searched are locally stored and displaye below the search bar. Depending on the UV index the color of the index will change to reflect the severity of the index. The icons on the five-day forecast will also change depending on the cloudiness of the day. This was a great project because I had to apply a lot of aspects of what I've learned over the past few weaks into one page. I had to build a page from scratch, grab data from an api, utilize local storage, and dynamically create html using javascript functions. In the future I would like to improve the overal design to be more appealing and add animations to replace the icons depending on the weather.
